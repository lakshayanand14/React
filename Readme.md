Question 1) What is Emmet?

Answer – Emmet is a free add on to the text editor like VS code. Emmet allows us to write shortcuts which are then expanded into full piece of code. By using Emmet, we can save our time on writing big commands. Moreover, with auto completion of our code via Emmet we can manage the type error and missing tags which leads to more robust and valid files. The Emmet is a open source service which can be handled according to our customization. Emmet allows us to use similar conventions which can be written within HTML and CSS. Moreover, we can speed up our process for coding by creating elements, adding ID’S and class selector in CSS. Moreover, we can nest child and sibling elements in CSS very quickly to create a complex html structure. Emmet also provides other useful features which helps us to navigate, remove tags, merge lines and also let us add dummy text. 

Question 2) Difference between framework and Library?

Answer – 

1. Framework:

•	Framework provides ready to use tools, standards, templates, and policies for fast paced application development.
•	The framework controls calling of libraries for our code.
•	To leverage the benefits of a framework, a fresh application can be developed following the framework’s guideline.
•	With the help of frameworks, we can easily create applications and deploy them.
•	Helps us develop a software application quickly.
•	Intent of a framework is to reduce complexity of our software development process.

2. Library:

•	Provides reusable function for our code.
•	Our code controls when and where to call a library.
•	Library can be added to augment the features of an existing application.
•	Facilitates program binding.
•	Helps us to reuse a software function.
•	Intent of a library is to provide reusable software functionality.

Question 3) What is CDN Links and why do we use it?

Answer – A CDN is a content delivery network. It is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. 

CDN is used to improve website performance by reducing latency and providing a more reliable connection.

CDN is a wiser choice when we are just starting with react or we have to work upon a pre-built website in order to include react components. CDN links are handy and does not require much setup hence we can add React components with fewer lines of code.

Question 4) Why react is called react?

Answer – 
•	React is declarative which means we can tell what we want when we write our code in react therefore, then it solves the code and build the user interface in web browser.
•	React helps us to break down our code into smaller components and we can use these components wherever we want.
•	Instead of re-rendering the whole site react can update only the things that are different before an event. For example, we update our profile picture, the image is the only thing that is re-rendered and everything else remains same and nothing else is updated on site except the profile picture.

Question 5) What is cross Origin?

Answer- Cross origin attribute is valid on <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script> and <video> elements which provides for cross origin resource sharing which defines how the element handles cross origin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element’s fetched data. Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute. 

The cross-origin content attribute on a media element is CORS settings attribute and these attributes are enumerated, which can have following possible values:

•	Anonymous: Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to ‘same-origin’. There is no exchange of user credentials via cookies, client-side SSL certificates or HTTP authentication, unless destination is same origin.
•	User-credentials: Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to ‘include’ and user credentials are always included.
•	“ “ : Setting the attribute name to an empty value like cross origin or cross origin=”” , is same as anonymous.

An invalid keyword and empty string will be handles as anonymous keyword.

Question 6) What is a difference between react and reactDOM?

Answer- While building web applications in react it uses two packages React and ReactDOM.

React package holds React source for components, state, props and all the code which is react.

The ReactDOM is a glue between React and the dom. ReactDOM is used to mount our application to index.html file. Hence to mount our index.html with react application we use React.render().

Question 7) What is the difference between React.development.JS and React.Production.js?

Answer- Development is the stage of an application before it is made public while production is the stage of an application after it is made public. Development stage is 3 to 5 times slower than production stage.

Development build is used for building applications. We have source maps, debugging, and often hot reloading ability in those builds. The production builds run in production mode which means this code is running on client’s machine.
